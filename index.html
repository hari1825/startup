      I am studying software engineering because I am passionate about creating
      innovative solutions that can make a positive impact on people's lives. I
      believe that through this field, I can contribute to advancements in
      technology and help address various societal challenges. Additionally, the
      continuous learning and problem-solving nature of software engineering
      keep me motivated and engaged." "I have always been fascinated by
      technology and its ability to solve complex problems. Software
      engineering, in particular, offers a unique blend of creativity and logic
      that I find incredibly appealing. IIT's reputation for excellence in
      education and its focus on practical, hands-on learning made it the
      perfect choice for me to pursue this degree.""I have always been
